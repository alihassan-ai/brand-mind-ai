FR-SH-001  The system SHALL implement Shopify OAuth 2.0 to allow authenticated
           users to authorize the platform to access their Shopify store data.

FR-SH-002  The OAuth authorization request SHALL request, at minimum, the
           following Shopify permission scopes: read_products, read_orders,
           read_customers, read_inventory.

FR-SH-003  Upon successful OAuth callback, the system SHALL securely store
           the Shopify access token, encrypting it at rest using AES-256
           encryption with an environment-configured encryption key.

FR-SH-004  The system SHALL associate exactly one connected Shop record per
           authenticated user session, identified by the Shopify store domain.

FR-SH-005  Upon successful OAuth authorization, the system SHALL automatically
           initiate an initial full data synchronization of the connected store.

FR-SH-006  The system SHALL expose the connected shop domain in a separate
           session-scoped cookie to identify the active merchant store context.

FR-SH-007  The system SHALL support disconnection and re-authorization of a

           of six (6) months of historical order and customer data.

FR-DS-003  The synchronization engine SHALL support incremental synchronization
           using cursor-based pagination to process only records modified or
           created since the last successful sync operation.

FR-DS-004  The system SHALL persist synchronization cursor positions per data
           entity to enable resumption of interrupted sync operations without
           data duplication.

FR-DS-005  The system SHALL normalize and persist all synchronized Shopify
           data into the platform's relational schema, decoupling downstream
           analytics from direct Shopify API dependencies.

FR-DS-006  The system SHALL record a SyncEvent audit entry for every sync
           operation, capturing: start timestamp, end timestamp, entity type,
           record counts, and terminal status (success or failure).

FR-DS-007  The system SHALL expose a manual sync trigger endpoint accessible
           by authenticated users to initiate an on-demand synchronization.

FR-DS-008  The system SHALL support background auto-synchronization that
           operates independently of user interaction, ensuring data recency
           without requiring explicit merchant intervention.

FR-DS-009  Sync operations SHALL be idempotent; re-running a sync for an
           already-synchronized period SHALL not produce duplicate records.

FR-DS-010  The system SHALL expose a diagnostic endpoint providing the
           real-time status, progress, and error detail of active or most
           recent sync operations.

FR-DS-011  Product records SHALL include: title, product type, vendor, tags,

              and core values inferred from product and order data.
           b) Operational DNA — price architecture, catalog structure, and
              vendor mix including HHI vendor concentration score.
           c) Customer DNA — RFM segmentation distribution, average LTV,
              repeat purchase rate, and basket affinity patterns.
           d) Product Intelligence — velocity scoring, lifecycle stage
              classification, growth rate, and performance tier per product.

FR-DN-003  The system SHALL classify each product into one of the following
           lifecycle stages: rising, peak, declining, or dead, based on
           computed velocity and recency metrics.

FR-DN-004  The system SHALL classify product price points into a minimum of
           seven (7) price bands (e.g., budget, value, mid-range, premium,
           luxury, ultra-luxury) and determine the distribution of catalog
           items across these bands.

FR-DN-005  The system SHALL compute an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
           score per customer and assign each customer to one of ten (10)
           defined RFM segments.

FR-DN-006  The system SHALL assess data sufficiency prior to computing Store
           DNA and surface a DataSufficiency record containing: readiness
           status, blocking conditions (if any), and warnings.

           audit table, capturing: agent type, initiating user, shop context,
           execution timestamp, duration, and terminal status.

FR-AD-007  The system SHALL log all API usage in a UsageLog table to support
           cost attribution and operational analytics.

================================================================================
17. NOTIFICATION AND EMAIL SERVICES
================================================================================

FR-NE-001  The system SHALL transmit transactional emails via an external
           email delivery service (Resend). All outbound emails SHALL
           originate from a configured sender address.

FR-NE-002  The system SHALL send an email verification message to users
           upon registration containing a unique verification link.

FR-NE-003  The system SHALL send a password reset email containing a
           time-limited, single-use reset link upon submission of a valid
           forgot-password request.

FR-NE-004  The system SHALL include a fallback sender address configuration
           to ensure email delivery continuity in the event the primary
           configured sender is unavailable.

================================================================================
18. DATA INTEGRITY AND AUDIT LOGGING
================================================================================

FR-DI-001  All monetary values (prices, revenue, refunds) SHALL be stored
           using a fixed-precision decimal type to ensure financial accuracy
           and avoid floating-point rounding errors.

FR-DI-002  Foreign key relationships SHALL be enforced with cascading delete
           constraints to ensure referential integrity upon parent record
           deletion.

FR-DI-003  Deletion of a User record SHALL cascade to delete all associated
           Shop, Order, Product, Customer, KPI, and Intelligence records
           owned by that user.

FR-DI-004  The system SHALL maintain a SyncEvent log capturing the full
           lifecycle of each synchronization operation, retaining records
           for post-incident analysis.

FR-DI-005  The system SHALL maintain EvidenceChain records linking each AI-
           generated recommendation or insight to the specific data points
           that grounded the output.

FR-DI-006  The system SHALL maintain BusinessMemorySnapshot records capturing
           periodic snapshots of store state to support longitudinal trend
           analysis.

FR-DI-007  The system SHALL maintain a DataQualityLog tracking data freshness
           and completeness indicators per shop over time.

================================================================================
19. NON-FUNCTIONAL CONSTRAINTS AFFECTING FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR
================================================================================

FR-NF-001  All API endpoints SHALL validate request payloads against defined
           schemas using Zod schema validation. Requests failing validation
           SHALL be rejected with an HTTP 400 response and a structured
           error descriptor.

FR-NF-002  The system SHALL enforce multi-tenancy isolation. All data access
           operations SHALL be scoped to the authenticated user's associated
           shop identifier. Cross-tenant data access SHALL be prohibited.

FR-NF-003  The system SHALL use composite database indices on (shopId,
           resource) and (shopId, date) keys to ensure query performance
           within acceptable response time bounds at production data volumes.

FR-NF-004  The system SHALL check data sufficiency before executing
           computationally intensive intelligence operations (Store DNA,
           NextHit generation) and return a structured error response if
           thresholds are not met, rather than producing unreliable outputs.

FR-NF-005  AI agent executions involving external LLM API calls SHALL be
           bounded by configurable timeout thresholds to prevent indefinite
           blocking of user-facing request handlers.

================================================================================
20. EXTERNAL INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

FR-EI-001  Shopify API Interface:
           The system SHALL communicate with the Shopify REST API (version
           2024-10 or later) using authenticated requests bearing a valid
           merchant access token. The system SHALL handle Shopify API rate
           limits using back-off and retry logic.

FR-EI-002  OpenAI API Interface:
           The system SHALL interface with the OpenAI API using the following
           models:
           a) gpt-4o — for complex reasoning tasks (executive briefs,
              launch kit generation, deep risk analysis).
           b) text-embedding-3-small — for semantic embedding and
              similarity-based retrieval operations.
           API keys SHALL be sourced from environment configuration and SHALL
           NOT be embedded in source code.

FR-EI-003  Google Trends API Interface:
           The system SHALL interface with the Google Trends data service
           to retrieve keyword trend interest time-series data for use in
           NextHit scoring and market analysis.

FR-EI-004  Resend Email API Interface:
           The system SHALL interface with the Resend transactional email
           API to deliver verification, password reset, and notification
           emails. The system SHALL surface delivery failure errors to the
           originating request handler.

FR-EI-005  Database Interface:
           The system SHALL communicate with a PostgreSQL-compatible
           relational database via the Prisma ORM. All schema migrations
           SHALL be managed via Prisma migration files.
